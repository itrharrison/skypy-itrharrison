Overview

### Purpose of this Document

This document is intended to specify how information should be communicated within the SkyPy project, to try and ensure:
  - Messages arrive in a timely way
  - Messages are visible to all relevant parties
  - Messages are not unneccessarily duplicated
  - Messages are not missed

We will provide an overview of the guidelines, followed by specfic guidance for different platforms.

### List of Available Communication Channels

  2. SkyPy Slack (private)
      - Channels
      - Direct messages
      - Voice and video calls
  3. [SkyPy Google Group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/skypy) (private)
  4. SkyPy Zoom Open Office (private)
  5. SkyPy Google Docs comments (private)


### Suggested Order of Preference

We suggest the below prder of preference for communicating within SkyPy. Before sending a message, please think about whether you could send it in a form higher up the list.

  1. Public Github Issue
  2. Slack channel
  3. Slack direct message

### Voice and Video vs Written

Voice and video communication has the signficant benefit of allowing communication of tone, but also means the communication is not (by default) recorded for later visibility, and response is required immediately. We encourage voice and video communication whenever appropriate, but please bear in mind these caveats.
